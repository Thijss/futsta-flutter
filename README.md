# Futsta Flutter

Welcome to my first Flutter app!

This project serves as the frontend for Futsta, a Flutter application for keeping track of my futsal team statistics (goals/assists).

Mainly this project is used to learn about Flutter.

This app is connected to a FastAPI backend running on AWS lambda. To see the backend part of this app, head over to [futsta-api](https://github.com/Thijss/futsta-api).

## Deployment
This project is deployed as a static web app using AWS S3, AWS Route 53, AWS Certificate Manager and AWS Cloudfront.

## Acknowledgements
Building this app, I've used ChatGPT-4 a lot. Given that this is my first Flutter/Dart project, much of the Dart syntax/Flutter Framework was new to me.

By asking ChatGPT-4 question like: "Explain this Flutter concept to me" or "Build a flutter screen with three buttons aligned to the left" development sped up and I learned a lot on the way.

## Roadmap/ToDo's

- Add documentation for deployment
- Add tests
